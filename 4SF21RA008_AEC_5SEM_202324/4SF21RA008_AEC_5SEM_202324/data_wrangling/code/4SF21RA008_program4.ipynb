Download the dataset: For this exercise, we will use the \"World Happiness Report 2021\" dataset available at https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2021/.\n"," 2. Open OpenRefine: Launch OpenRefine and create a new project.\n"," 3. Import the dataset: Click on the \"Create Project\" button and select \"From Clipboard\" or \"From a Google Sheet\". Paste the dataset into the text box and\n","click \"Next\".\n"," 4. Clean the dataset: Once the data is imported, we need to clean and transform it. Here are the steps:\n"," a. Remove unnecessary columns: If there are any columns that are not required for the analysis, remove them by selecting the column header and\n","clicking on the \"Remove this column\" button.\n"," b. Rename columns: Rename the columns to more meaningful names. For example, rename the \"Country\" column to \"Country Name\".\n"," c. Remove duplicate rows: If there are any duplicate rows, remove them by selecting the rows and clicking on the \"Remove duplicates\" button.\n"," d. Transform data: Use GREL (General Refine Expression Language) code to transform the data. For example, to convert the \"Happiness Score\" column to\n","a numerical format, use the following GREL code: value.toNumber()\n"," e. Filter rows: Use GREL code to filter rows based on certain conditions. For example, to filter rows where the \"Happiness Score\" is greater than 7, use\n","the following GREL code: value > 7\n"," 5. Export the dataset: Once the dataset is cleaned and transformed, export it in a format that is suitable for further analysis. For example, export it as a\n","CSV file."],"metadata":{"id":"aZRPQICPK7aF"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Conclusion: This exercise provides a hands-on approach to utilizing OpenRefine for data wrangling tasks.\n","It covers essential operations such as cleaning, transforming, and filtering data using both manual and GREL-based techniques.\n","By following these steps, users can effectively prepare the dataset for subsequent analysis or visualization tasks.\n","OpenRefine's intuitive interface and powerful functionalities make it a valuable tool for data cleaning and preprocessing tasks in data science workflows."],"metadata":{"id":"zHR8yLzzQVjA"}}]}
